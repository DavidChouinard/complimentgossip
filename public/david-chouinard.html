In 2014, I started asking the people around me <em>Who are your most interesting friends?</em>. The responses were fascinating — I wanted to follow a few levels deep and more rigorously understand the people that influence me, but it became logistically overwhelming quickly.

In parrallel, I was also interested by a particular sub-genre of chain letters for recognizing best friends.

This is Compliment Gossip. Built atop the Node4j graph database, set in Playfair Display and powered by Lob.

<p>
This is an experiment and you're part of it. You and I are connected in some way.

<p>
Compliment Gossip will eventually be open to trees where I am not the root node. But until then, stand by — we're not quite ready to be <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">hunted</a>.
